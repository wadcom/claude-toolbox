Backlog is a PRIORITIZED list of things to be done. Higher priority items are
at the top.

Backlog is a FLAT list, there is no nesting structure. Each item stands on its
own.

Backlog items are like rocks. When you break a rock, you get several rocks. So
are backlog items: they can be split into smaller items or grouped back into
larger ones.

Each backlog item can have a SHORT description (no more than 3 sentences).

The highest priority items (the ones we will work on next), should be the
smallest (e.g. no more than 30 minutes of focused work of a senior engineer)
and have more details.

Backlog must be comprehensible (no more than 15 items). To achieve this, 
lower-priority items may be grouped into more coarse ones. Alternatively, the
scope of the entire initiative may be reduced (with the approval of the user).

The most important is the order of the first few items. The further we go down
the list, the less important it is to precisely prioritize items against each
other.

### Backlog example

````markdown
# [Initiative Name] Backlog

## Highest priority item

## Next priority item

[May have up to 3 sentences of description]

## Another item

## Low priority item which might need context

[May have up to 3 sentences of description]

...
````

**IMPORTANT**: if the item title is enough to recall what it is about, it 
SHOULD NOT have any description! In the example above, "Another item" is 
supposedly described well enough by its title, so it doesn't have any
description.
