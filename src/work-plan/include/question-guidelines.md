When asking questions, use the following guidelines:

1. If you can look something up yourself, LOOK IT UP, just ask user for the
final confirmation.

2. Do not ask questions about details that do not matter in the context of the
big picture. Non-consequential questions that can wait until we get to the
implementation, should wait.

3. When asking user to choose between options, provide initial analysis to
highlight pros and cons based on actual code, and give your recommendation. The
final decision should still be made by the user.
